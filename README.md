# opfpy

**A collection of tutorials and implementations of important algorithms in the field of control and optimization of power systems.**

Each tutorial and implementation is provided as a [Python Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with references to the original publication, with links to directly open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 

A full list of current implementations is provided [here](#current-implementations).

## Project Motivation
The fields of power system control and optimization is known for having a steep learning curve, especially for undergraduate students. Generally speaking, it often requires a strong background in:
 * electrical circuit theory
 * power system analysis
 * linear algebra
 * linear and nonlinear optimization

As someone who taught himself a lot of this material, I found an important lack of online resources (tutorials, public implementations, blog articles, etc.) compared to other currently popular fields (e.g., Machine Learning). I hope this project will contribute to bridging that gap.

## Who can opfpy be useful for?
I am a strong advocate of reproducing previous works from the literature to get a better understanding of a research field.

This repository is my attempt at learning about control and optimization in power systems, with a hands-on attitude, going in chronological order from the first important papers to today's research.

I believe ``opfpy`` can be useful for anyone looking to:
 * Start learning about power systems.
 * Get a better understanding of the core papers that have shapped the field as it is today.
 * Save time by not having to re-implement previous works.
 * Start using Python for modelling power systems (Python > MATLAB!).

## Contributing
I try to add the implementation of a new paper every week, but contributions are more than welcome! 

I also keep a list of papers that I intend to implement in the near future [here](#future-implementations). If you would like to implement any of those, or propose a non-listed paper, feel free to email me at robin.x.henry@gmail.com. Alternatively, you can also submit a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Current Implementations
These paper implementations are classified into different categories and then organized in chronological order.
